  <li><a href="Finalvolunteer.html">Volunteer</a></li>
    <p>Pitch in to help preserve America’s natural and cultural resources by volunteering at a state or national park. Volunteers of all ages and abilities are needed for one-time service activities and long-term commitments, and opportunities range from park improvements, upkeep and preservation</p>
    <p>Another way  can be as easy as picking up litter around your neighborhood with a few friends. When you pick up trash, you remove physical hazards for wildlife, decrease the pollution of groundwater, and protect habitat structure. And you can do it anywhere including rivers and beaches.</p>

    <h1><b>Education</b></h1>
	Want to read more on how education can help kids and ADULTS! can actually help save the enviroment? clink the link below!!!
	<li><a href="Finaleducate.html">Educate</a></li>
    <p>Environmental education is about being aware of the environment. This refers to all flowers and animals and includes all marine and wildlife. The planet is currently facing an increasing number of environmental challenges, which include climate change, global warming, droughts, water scarcity, floods, and pollution.
Children, as early as possible, should be aware of the environmental issues we’re facing.</p>
    <p>If educators and parents take over the entire burden in terms of environmental preservation, students won’t be prompted to take action for their environment. There should be much more to environmental education than just classes that promote environmental awareness and homework that requires some writing.</p>
